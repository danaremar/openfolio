# Openfolio

This is an **open-source portfolio** that you can personalize by making changes to **just one file**. It simply requires compilation, a change to the typescript config file, and the addition of desired photos, videos, and documents. It is simple to use and setup.

Angular v17, Bootstrap v5.3, and Bootstrap Icons v1.11 were used in its design.

## Install dependencies
Requires [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) installed on the environment. Use the following command in the terminal to install all dependencies (on Windows, use cmd to avoid PowerShell restrictions):

    npm install

Install process will take 1-5 minutes.

## Customize

### Files (images, videos, documents..)

Files can be found into  *`src/assets`* folder. For *projects* it's recommended to create one folder per each one.

There are some important files like:

 - **logo.svg**: represents the logo in the left side of the navbar.
 - **home-video.webm/.mp4**: represent home background video.
 - **profile.avif/.jpg**: represents your photo. Please put both images. If you want to convert to *.avif* file extension you can use: https://convertio.co/es/jpg-avif/
 - **contact-light.avif/.jpg**: represents contact background image when light theme is active.
 -  **contact-dark.avif/.jpg**: represents contact background image when dark theme is active.

If you want to remove stars effect, please remove *"src/stars.scss",* line in *`angular.json`* file.

### Recomendations

***Resources***
All images, videos, logos... must be non-copyrighted or yours. If you don't have your own resources, you can search in:
- Images / videos: [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/es/)
- Logo / image AI creation: [Bing chat (Copilot)](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=undexpand)
- Translator: [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/es/translator)


***Icons***
Use framework icons or in some cases SVG files, avoid images. In config.ts refers to imported framework icon classes.

- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) (included)
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) (not included): just add to `angular.json` & `package.json` files before compilation.

***Videos***
- **.webm**: smallest one but 90% device compatibility, recommended use with other formats
- **.mp4**: normal, recommended for compatibility


***Images***
- **.avif**: smallest one but 60% device compatibility, recommended use with other formats
- **.webp**: small but 90% device compatibility, recommended use with other formats
- **.jpg**: normal, recommended for compatibility
- **.png**: so heavy

## Build in local
Requires all dependencies installed & execute this command:

	npm s --o

Build process will take 5-10 seconds.

## Deploy on github pages
Just execute ***`gh-pages.cmd`*** in your GitHub repository (in local, doesn't matter the branch) or the following git commands:

	ng build --configuration=production --base-href="./"
	git add dist -f && git commit -m "GitHub pages upload"
	git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages

This script creates new branch called *gh-pages* which contains only your compiled files. When you complete that, go inside your project to "*Settings / Pages*" and select "*gh-pages*" to deploy.

Deploy process will take 1-5 minutes.
