# Openfolio

This is an **open-source portfolio** that you can personalize **fast, easy & realiable**. It simply requires compilation, some changes in typescript config files, and the addition of desired photos, videos, and documents. Simple to use & setup!

Angular v17, Bootstrap v5.3, and Bootstrap Icons v1.11 were used in its design.

### Files (images, videos, documents..)

Files can be found into  *`src/assets`* folder. For *projects* it's recommended to create one folder per each one.

There are some important files like:

 - **logo.svg**: represents the logo in the left side of the navbar.
 - **home-video.webm/.mp4**: represent home background video.
 - **profile.avif/.jpg**: represents your photo. Please put both images. If you want to convert to *.avif* file extension you can use: https://convertio.co/es/jpg-avif/
 - **contact-light.avif/.jpg**: represents contact background image when light theme is active.
 -  **contact-dark.avif/.jpg**: represents contact background image when dark theme is active.

If you want to remove stars effect, please remove *"src/stars.scss",* line in *`angular.json`* file.

### Recomendations

***Resources***
All images, videos, logos... must be non-copyrighted or yours. If you don't have your own resources, you can search in:
- Images / videos: [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/es/)
- Logo / image AI creation: [Bing chat (Copilot)](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=undexpand)
- Translator: [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/es/translator)


***Icons***
Use framework icons or in some cases SVG files, avoid images. In config.ts refers to imported framework icon classes.

- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) (included)
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) (not included): just add to `angular.json` & `package.json` files before compilation.

***Videos***
- **.webm**: smallest one but 90% device compatibility, recommended use with other formats
- **.mp4**: normal, recommended for compatibility


***Images***
- **.avif**: smallest one but 60% device compatibility, recommended use with other formats
- **.webp**: small but 90% device compatibility, recommended use with other formats
- **.jpg**: normal, recommended for compatibility
- **.png**: so heavy

## Build in local
Requires all dependencies installed & execute this command:

	npm s --o

Build process will take 5-10 seconds.

<br>

## Deploy on github pages
Just execute ***`gh-pages.cmd`*** in your GitHub repository (in local, doesn't matter the branch) or the following git commands:

	ng build --configuration=production --base-href="./"
	git add dist -f && git commit -m "GitHub pages upload"
	git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages

This script creates new branch called *gh-pages* which contains only your compiled files. When you complete that, go inside your project to "*Settings / Pages*" and select "*gh-pages*" to deploy.

Deploy process will take 1-5 minutes.
